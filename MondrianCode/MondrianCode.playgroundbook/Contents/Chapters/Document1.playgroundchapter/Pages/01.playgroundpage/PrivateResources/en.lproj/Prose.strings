**Piet Mondrian** was an artist from Holland who lived at the end of XIXth century and the first half of XXth century. He was one of the first members of the **abstract art**. This artist found on the geometric shapes the way to make an approach to the basic structure of the universe.

For him, the art shouldn't be **figurative**. It shouldn't imitate the reality but it had to be tool to explore beyond what our eyes see .

Today, his paintings are massively sold as decorative sheets. But, when we see one of his paintings, we can't forget that, beyond its esthetical beauty, the artist looked for a deeper reality comprehension.

Above you can see an example of Mondrian's geometrical paintings. Now we are going to copy using lines of **Swift** code.

We will join the current and past century thanks to **coding**.


Below you should declare as a `constants` the labels that are going to be your painting. Remember that you have to name each constant propperly. Thus when we reed them we will know which shape are they talking about.

You should place this objects into a coordinate axis on the screenor `liveview`.
